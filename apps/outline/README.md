## Opinion

Outline is an amazing knowledge base application. The team behind it is consistently improving the app, and following its updates shows their dedication. The installation process is straightforward (though I would love to see a Helm chart in the future) and updating the app is really easy. I’m genuinely glad this project exists— for me, it’s the best alternative to Confluence.

Excitingly, Outline will soon get a [GitLab integration](https://github.com/outline/outline/issues/6795#issuecomment-3530464228), which I’m really looking forward to.

Wishes: For school, I often work on a tablet. For that reason, an integration or support for something like [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) would be sublime!
